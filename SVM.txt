You can use a support vector machine (SVM) when your data has exactly two classes. An SVM classifies data by 
finding the best hyperplane that separates all data points of one class from those of the other class. 
The best hyperplane for an SVM means the one with the largest margin between the two classes. 
Margin means the maximal width of the slab parallel to the hyperplane that has no interior data points.

The support vectors are the data points that are closest to the separating hyperplane; these points are on the
 boundary of the slab. The following figure illustrates these definitions, with + indicating data points of type 1,
 and – indicating data points of type –1.
