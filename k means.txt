Image segmentation is the classification of an image into different groups. Many researches have been done in the area 
of image segmentation using clustering. There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is k-means 
clustering algorithm. K -means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm and it is used to
 segment the interest area from the background. But before applying K -means algorithm, first partial stretching 
enhancement is applied to the image to improve the quality of the image. Subtractive clustering method is data clustering
 method where it generates the centroid based on the potential value of the data points. So subtractive cluster is used 
to generate the initial centers and these centers are used in k-means algorithm for the segmentation of image. Then
 finally gaussian filter is applied to the segmented image to remove any unwanted region from the image.
